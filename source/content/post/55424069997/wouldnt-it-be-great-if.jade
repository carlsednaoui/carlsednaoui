  h1 Wouldn’t it be great if…?

  p Couple nights ago, over dinner, my girlfriend and I were talking about startups and this phrase came up:

  p <em>'Wouldn't it be great if…?'</em>

  p Take a second to think about it. When it comes to your startup, when I say ‘<em>Wouldn’t it be great if…’</em>&nbsp;what comes to mind? If you think about your product, user acquisition strategy or PR outreach, what ideas do these words evoke?

  p <em>'Wouldn't it be great if…?'</em>

  p If you were to ask your team this question, what responses would you get? (There’s only one way to find out.)&nbsp;<span>This combination of words appears to be the perfect way to question the status quo and bring new ideas to light.</span>

  p As soon as I’m done with <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a>&nbsp;(and join the workforce again) I’d love to implement a monthly email that goes out to my team&nbsp;and ask this very question: <em>Wouldn’t it be great if…?&nbsp;</em>I’d also love to test this with our customers (or a segment of them).

  p How do you come up with new ideas? If you’ve ever done anything similar, <a href="https://twitter.com/carlsednaoui">I’d love to hear about it!</a>
