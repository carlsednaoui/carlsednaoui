<p><strong>TLDR: </strong>It is really easy to scrape ~28,000 profile email addresses from GitHub. If you don’t want unsolicited emails then I’d recommend changing your public email address to your Twitter handle.</p>
<h2 id="the-backstory">The backstory</h2>
<p>New York City was set to a halt this past Sunday night due to hurricane Sandy. As it turns out, rare are the occasions when I find myself at home, with free time and with energy left… so, as any good dev-in-training would, I decided to pop open a terminal window. While refactoring some code for <a href="http://coursebacon.com/">CourseBacon</a> (which you should totally go visit if you’re looking to learn something new) I suddenly felt an urge to do something a bit more exciting than working on old code.</p>
<p>Being an avid HN follower, I’ve noticed that most devs tend to hate (almost) every recruiter out there - and with good reasons. On the same note, I recently got an email from a good friend saying that he just received a crappy recruiter email that had <strong>nothing </strong>to do with his skill set. He also mentioned that the recruiter got his email address via GitHub.</p>
<p>My friend was extremely surprised when I told him that he can remove his public email address directly from his GitHub profile settings by simply leaving the “Email” field blank (I choose to show my Twitter handle - more on that later).</p>

<h2 id="the-fun-begins">The fun begins</h2>
<p>As the gears started turning in my head I wondered how many devs were making the same “mistake” as my friend - leaving their email address exposed when they really didn’t mean to. </p>
<p>After taking a quick look at some GitHub search results and glancing at their API I came up with <strike>the following cod</strike>e (<strong>EDIT:</strong> the gist has been deleted). I let this bad boy run for couple hours (was grabbing drinks with the neighbors at this point) and, next thing you know, here’s the result:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/email-addresses.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Yup, that’s right, over 28,000 email address straight from GitHub. There is absolutely nothing advanced about this code and, as you can see, anyone can create a “small” database with over ~28,000 devs email addresses. If you want to get fancy you can also get each user’s number of repos and followers and so on.</p>
<p>This is absolutely shocking when you think about it! Since when it is so easy to get ~28,000 email addresses of people making an average 70k+? As a matter of fact, what email addresses are you looking for? Some @google.com emails? Got it! Some @facebook.com emails? You bet. </p>
<p>Note I will <strong>NOT</strong> be sharing this list with anyone. Also, I understand that there is a possibility that many (ok, lets say most) people on this list have <em>chosen</em> to leave their email address visible because they want <em>to engage with the community</em>. But, if you hate unsolicited mail as much as I do, I would advise that instead of having your email publicly available you <strong>leave your Twitter handle</strong>. People can engage with you through Twitter and, if needed, ask for your email address then and there. By doing this you’ll get zero unsolicited emails from the GitHub vultures.</p>
<p>Just like you, I really, really hate spam. But, before complaining about how annoying unsolicited emails are, I’d like to challenge you to see if there is anything <strong>YOU</strong> can do to proactively protect your inbox (that’s right, protect it).</p>
<p>To all my NYC folks, I hope that you’re safe and that (unlike me) you do have power and phone signal in your area.</p>
