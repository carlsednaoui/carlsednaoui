<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Last Summer (2013) I had the pleasure of attending <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> where I met <a href="https://twitter.com/tbuchok">Tom</a>. Tom and I spent a good chunk of the summer hacking on projects together and, towards the end the summer, <strong>we decided to create an <a href="http://www.mailcharts.com/">email marketing tool</a></strong>. We’re the perfect combo: <a href="http://composenew.com/">Tom’s</a> been in the email marketing industry for a while and I’ve been a marketer (whatever that means) for 3+ years.</p>
<p>After a few days of hacking, <strong>a really rough prototype of <a href="http://www.mailcharts.com/">MailCharts</a> was born</strong>. (I’ll explain our development approach in another post.)</p>
<p><strong>Build it, they will come…</strong></p>
<p>… said no successful entrepreneur ever. If you’re reading this, you’re likely to know the importance of user feedback. <strong>Building something in a silo is the best way to build something nobody wants.</strong></p>
<p>The problem is, <strong>nobody</strong> cares about your product. Seriously. <strong>Getting feedback is wayyy more difficult than your average blog post makes it seem.</strong></p>
<p>Why? Because not only do you need to find people interested in your product or service, but you also need to find users that are supportive (new ideas can be a fragile thing), willing to trust you and — ideally — <strong>willing to pay</strong> for your product or service.</p>
<p>See, not easy!</p>
<p><strong>Meet Product Hunt</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.producthunt.co/">Product Hunt</a> is a really simple (and beautiful) website <strong>where </strong>community<strong> members post new products or services</strong>. Once something is posted, the <strong>community</strong> can upvote it and share their thoughts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.producthunt.com"><img src="/images/posts/product-hunt-1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Before posting MailCharts on Product Hunt, I asked <a href="href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rrhoover">Ryan</a> if he thought it’d be a good fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/466602092271251457"><img alt="image" src="/images/posts/product-hunt-mailcharts-twitter-convo.png"></a></p>
<p>A few minutes later the <a href="http://www.producthunt.co/posts/mailcharts">post went live</a>. Sweet frijoles Batman! Never have I seen a <strong>community</strong> that is <strong>so supportive, welcoming and full of constructive criticism</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Product Hunt is all about the community</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We received tons of support and valuable insights — and even got to connect with a few companies interested in using our public API (when it becomes available).</p>
<p>Here’s a few comments:</p>

<p><strong>Charge a credit card, you must</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your most valuable feedback will come from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer">customers</a></strong> (notice the “monetary consideration” part). Fremium might work for some but, IMO, free users are not necessarily a good representation of those willing to pay for what you offer.</p>
<p>So, how did MailCharts do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Product Hunt drove 1,712 sessions and 1,385 new users</li>
<li>Our <a href="https://app.mailcharts.com/signup?plan=1">sign up page</a> also received 387 unique page views (aka: visitors with some form of purchasing intent)</li>
<li>We received 30+ new (paying) users in less than a week</li>
<li>Our <a href="http://www.mailcharts.com/email-marketing-ideas">mailing list</a> received over 100 new subscribers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quick math: Assuming new users stay with MailCharts for 10 months (we have no historical data), Product Hunt drove $</strong>8,700<strong> in sales ($29 <em> 10 months </em> 30 customers = $8,700).</strong></p>
<p>Buuuuut, much more important than new user count, we received <strong>tons of actionable feedback. </strong>One thing is clear: Product Hunt drives quality traffic!</p>
<p>My experience with Product Hunt has been amazing. Hats off to Ryan and his team for building such a great product and community — you’re doing it right!</p>
<p>If you’re looking to discover the best new products, head over to <a href="http://www.producthunt.com">Product Hunt</a> and sign up. An incredible community awaits!</p>
