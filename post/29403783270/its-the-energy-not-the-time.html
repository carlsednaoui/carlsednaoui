<p>Most people have a tendency to believe that Time is their most limited resource. I’d like to differ and say that our most limited resource is Energy.</p>
<p>Everyday, after waking up, you only have a limited amount of Energy available to spend. Today, since you are young and handsome, you have a great deal of Energy. Tomorrow, you’ll be old, handsome nonetheless, but you’ll have less Energy.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, some tasks require more Energy than others. Also, some tasks <em>will</em> affect your energy levels. I mean, rarely will you go through an hour of answering emails and tweets and feel like “Hot damn, I’m in the zone! Lets do this for another 4 hours”. (And if you do, then try call verifying leads.) The same is true after spending an hour on HN - your energy level just drops. On the other hand, if you’re coding up some cool new feature an hour will feel like 10 minutes. Even though coding takes a lot of energy, in my opinion, it doesn’t drastically decrease your energy levels (but rather does so gradually, throughout the day).</p>
<p>Next time you have to decide whether to do something or not, don’t only measure how much time it will take you - also take into account how much energy it requires. Also, since you’re as young as you’ll ever be again, it’s a good idea to pursue your most ambitious, energy demanding, ideas today. I’m sure that your older you will be grateful.</p>
