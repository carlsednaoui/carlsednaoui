<p><strong>tldr:</strong> Having an accountability partner has helped me remain motivated when the temptation to quit was strong. I encourage you to find an accountability partner to keep you in check - as well as help you track and achieve realistic and measurable goals.</p>
<p>I hate running. Let me rephrase that, I have yet to take pleasure in running. I’ve been struggling to keep up the “good habit” of running 3 times a week. It’s something I want to do, but it’s also something that I dread. Thanks to a friend I was able to remain motivated and keep up with my jogging routine - even now that the weather has dropped to 40F in NYC (that’s 5 degrees Celsius). This was the 1st time that I experienced the power of an accountability partner. I am now repeating this (having an accountability partner) to go through a 8 days cleanse and so far it’s working wonderfully well.</p>
<p>Ok, so let’s talk about YOU now. The new year is just starting and, chances are, <strong>you have some pretty ambitious goals</strong> you’d like to get through in 2013. Looking back, 2012 probably started off the same way: Many ambitious goals, endless to-do lists and, by the end of the year, you realized that you only achieved some of them. <strong>What are you going to do differently this year to achieve your goals?</strong> What product(s) are you going to ship by the end of 2013? Think about it. No seriously.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified your goals, it’s time to find your accountability partner. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_partner">Wikipedia</a> “An accountability partner is a person who coaches another person in terms of helping the other person keep a commitment”. <strong>You now need to find someone</strong>, anyone - yes, even me, <strong>to help you stay on track with your goals.</strong></p>
<p>There are <strong>3 important things</strong> to keep in mind when using the power of an accountability partner.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell your accountability partner WHAT goal you want to be kept accountable for (yes, I know, sounds obvious)</li>
<li>Make sure you provide both: a goal and a deadline</li>
<li>Make sure that your goal is MEASURABLE<ul>
<li><strong>A good example:</strong> Finish the redesign wireframes for CourseBacon by January 15. This include the resources index page and the resources show page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now do me a <strong>HUGE</strong> favor: <strong>Write down a measurable goal and send it to a friend</strong> and ask him/ her to become your accountability partner. Actually, here’s my offer, if you can’t find an accountability partner<strong> I’d be more than happy to become yours</strong> - I’ll do this with the first 10 people that reach out. My email is carlsed[a.t]ThatGoogleEmailThing.com.</p>
<p>Give it a shot, what do you have to lose?</p>
<p>P.S. I’d love to hear how you stay motivated, let me know in the comments or on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5017385">Hacker News</a>.</p>
